                MONITORING SYSTEM</h1>

            <p>In this paper an efficient system is presented which can predict the ideal crop for a
                particular piece of land based on the input provided by the customer, for a perfect yield. The yield
                of a crop is based on numerous factor and a Smart Monitoring system is built in the project, which
                will keep track of the various factors in the field and provide real-time updates to the user through
                a web application. Sensors connected with an Arduino constantly monitor the nutrients of the soil
                and update them in a firebase real-time database. Relying on the farmer’s vast experience and the
                input provided by the application several human errors can be minimized, and farming can happen
                in a systematic and efficient way.</p>
            
            <p>In the global age of modern medicine, humans have managed to optimize the mortality
                rate of the world, but with these advancements also comes the burden of global food shortages
                and poverty, making the agriculture industry one of the most important profession. In India the
                agriculture industry employs 41% of people, and amounts to 18% of the country’s GDP. Still the
                ways of farming have remained relatively outdated. Farmers relying on their traditional
                experience have generally produced great yields but in many cases have destroyed huge harvests
                due to wrong judgement calls as the traditional method are prone to human errors.</p>
            
            <p>These errors can range from over watering the crops to over-estimating the nutrients of the
                soil, using excess pesticides or even planting the wrong crop. These errors can be easily avoided if
                the farmers have exact data on their field and then utilize their judgement to adjust the various
                supplements they provide to their crops, which not only brings the risk of human errors down but
                also eliminates the extra cost they would have to endure due to excess addition of fertilizers to the
                soil.</p>
            <h3>Objectives</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>To design an efficient system which can predict the ideal crop for a given land based on
                    the inputs provided by the user</li>
                <li>Monitoring system constantly checks the state of the field after frequent intervals, and
                    updates the user on changes in the values of various factors of their field</li>
                <li>Provide accurate weather forecasts for accurate decision making</li>
                <li>To provide customers with a user friendly interpretation of the through a web application</li>
            </ul>
