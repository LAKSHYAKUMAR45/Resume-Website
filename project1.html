            <p>In this project an efficient and accurate model is presented which can analyze and
                quantify the sentiment behind statements on large scale datasets. Sentiment analysis is an
                ongoing field of research in text mining. Sentiment analysis is the computational
                treatment of opinions, sentiments and subjectivity of text.This project involves the study
                of several deep learning sentiment analysis models, their applications, their challenges,
                and construction of a sentiment analysis model of one of the proposed approach that best
                suits our needs (Classification of sentiments in Twitter and Metacritic data). In this
                project I aim to use the Valence Aware Dictionary for sentiment Reasoner (VADER) to
                classify the sentiments expressed in Twitter data and Metacritic data.</p>
            
            <p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence in which computers
                analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful
                way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform
                tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship
                extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.
                Sentiment analysis is an approach to natural language processing which identifies the
                emotional tone behind a body of text.
                In order to study sentiment analysis, we first have to ask ourselves some basic questions.
                What is sentiment analysis? Why do we need it? What are its applications? What are the
                different types of sentiment analysis? and how many ways are there to perform these
                tasks? We will uncover these topics in our project.</p>

                <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To perform Sentiment Analysis on brief text statements acquired from product
                    evaluations and tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP).</li>
                <li>Following the generation of overall sentiment analysis for the statements, the goal
                    is to determine the subject in the statement.</li>
                <li>The project's subsequent study is to determine if the same reasoning can be
                    applied in statements including informal material (i.e., language used on social
                    media).</li>
                <li>For the formal and informal structures we shall use Metacritic Game Reviews and
                    Tweets respectively as they capture the essence of the structures we aim to test.</li>
